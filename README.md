Project Overview:
This dataset contains simulated data related to manufacturing defects observed during quality control processes. It includes information such as defect type, detection date, location within the product, severity level, inspection method used, and repair costs.This project is a machine learning-based defect classification system. The model analyzes input data containing defect attributes and predicts the severity of the defect (e.g., minor, moderate, critical)). It provides key metrics such as Accuracy and F1 score for performance evaluation.

Directory Structure:
main.py: The main script for predictions.

README.md: This file.

Usage Instruction:
1)Execute the main.py by using "uvicorn main:app --reload
2)Test API in postman and upload the dataset and send request
3)Then create a new post request to train the data 
4)Then create a new post request for prediction 

Performance Metrics:
1)Accuracy: 0.305
2)F1 Score: 0.304
